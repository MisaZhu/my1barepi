TUTORIAL 6
----------

This is an introduction to bare-metal programming on Raspberry Pi using
C language. This module creates a program that simply echoes whatever
byte that is detected on the incoming UART line.

---------
Objective
---------

1- To understand how a RS232 UART interface can be implemented

----------
Background
----------

The RS232 UART interface is still relevant in current systems - mainly used
as a fallback method to access a system.

--------
Contents
--------

As usual, the new uart module is written as 'uart.c' and 'uart.h'. But this
time it is placed directly in the 'modules' folder.

In order to implement UART, the gpio module should also include a feature to
change pull-{up,down} settings of a GPIO pin.

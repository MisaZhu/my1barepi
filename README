MY1BAREPI CODE TUTORIAL
-----------------------

More like a personal note I made while trying to develop bare-metal codes for
Raspberry Pi. I want to use C but some things still need assembly, so I also
added (started with) a project using assembly. On the hardware side, I only
have a B+ model available, so some stuffs may not be usable for earlier models.
I also have compiled some of the codes for the V2 board.

I have two main references while working on this at the early stage:

- http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/index.html
  = a site at University of Cambridge which provides stuffs using assembly
- https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi
  = code repository at github for examples on bare-metal in C

I also refer to this site a lot when trying to get things to work for the V2
board and working on video (graphics):

- http://www.valvers.com/open-software/raspberry-pi/

The Embedded Linux site is also found to be very helpful:

- http://elinux.org/RPi_Documentation

To generate executable binaries, I built my own cross compiler using
arm-gcc.build script available in my1ubuild project. The codes here have been
compiled on both Linux and Windows (with MinGW32) platforms - notice the
makefiles have been setup to build on both.

TUTORIAL 06
-----------

This is an introduction to bare-metal programming on Raspberry Pi using
C language. This module creates a program that simply echoes whatever
byte that is detected on the incoming UART line.

---------
Objective
---------

1- To understand how a RS232 UART interface can be implemented

----------
Background
----------

The RS232 UART interface is still relevant in current systems - mainly used
as a fallback (if not the main) method to access (especially) embedded systems.

--------
Contents
--------

The new uart module is written as 'uart.c' and 'uart.h', which are placed
directly in the tZZ_modules folder.

In order to implement UART, the gpio module should also include a feature to
change pull-{up,down} settings of a GPIO pin.

------------------
ThingsToThinkAbout
------------------

There is currently only 1 UART port (pins 14 & 15) available on the Raspberry
Pi for external interface. What if we need two serial interfaces?

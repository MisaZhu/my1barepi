TUTORIAL 03
-----------

This is an introduction to bare-metal programming on Raspberry Pi using
C language. This module shows how to use the interrupt facility on BCM2835.

---------
Objective
---------

1- To explore interrupt facilities available on BCM2835
2- To understand how an interrupt can be used for event triggers (timer)
3- To understand the need for low-level access for interrupt configuration

----------
Background
----------

Interrupts are very useful to have - many applications appreciate having the
possibility of event-based implementation.

Most of the time, configuring interrupt facilities can only be done using
assembly. Notice that the code in 'boot.s' is significantly larger, and
different from the previous tutorials.

--------
Contents
--------

Only the top-level codes are 'main.c'. The module-specific codes can be found
in respective source files in tZZ_modules/src folder.

-----------
ThingsToTry
-----------

* Write a code to generate square-waves
  - at different frequencies on three separate GPIO pins
  - simple form of multi-tasking (i.e. static scheduling)
  - verify the generated signal on an oscilloscope

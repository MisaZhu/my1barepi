TUTORIAL 3
----------

This is an introduction to bare-metal programming on Raspberry Pi using
C language. This module shows how to use the interrupt facility on BCM2835. It
also shows a rewrite of the timer/gpio module in order to utilize interrupt.

---------
Objective
---------

1- To explore interrupt facilities available on BCM2835
2- To understand how an interrupt can be used for event triggers (timer)

----------
Background
----------

Interrupts are very useful to have - many applications appreciate having the
possibility of event-based implementation.

Most of the time, configuring interrupt facilities can only be done using
assembly. Notice that the code in 'boot.s' is significantly larger, and
different from the previous tutorials.

Contents
--------

Interrupt module in 'interrupt.c' source and 'interrupt.h' header files.

------------------
ThingsToThinkAbout
------------------

An interrupt facility allows the concept of event-based processing. Looking
at the BCM2835 controller, find all the hardware events that can be uniquely
identified. How can a software event be introduced to  the system?

---------
Challenge
---------

Try to write a code to generate waveforms at different frequencies on three
separate GPIO pins. This is to show a simple form of multi-tasking (i.e. static
scheduling). Verify the generated signal on an oscilloscope.

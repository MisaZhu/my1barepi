TUTORIAL 5
----------

This is an introduction to bare-metal programming on Raspberry Pi using
C language. This module creates a program that reads raw data from a
temperature/humidity sensor and sends them to UART terminals.

This tutorial also reveals that the ARM controller used here does not have
an integer division hardware and therefore, this operation has to be done
in software. The code in utils module shows how this can be done.

TUTORIAL 5
----------

This is an introduction to bare-metal programming on Raspberry Pi using
C language. This module creates a program that reads raw data from a
temperature/humidity sensor and dislay a selected value to a pair of
7-segments. A module for 7-segment interface has been created for this.

---------
Objective
---------

1- To understand how to display a multi-digit value on 7-segments
2- To understand how a 'protocol' can be implementated

----------
Background
----------

Temperature/humidity sensors are among the most commonly used sensor.

--------
Contents
--------

Codes related to implement the protocol to read from AM2303 Temperature /
Humidity sensor is in 'main.c'. The 7-segment interface code has been
rewritten as a module in '7seg.c' source and '7seg.h' header files.

------------------
ThingsToThinkAbout
------------------

Showing a single value on multiple 7-segments require a breakdown of the value
into multiple decimal digits based on its positional value. 

---------
Challenge
---------

Try to create an interface to 2 x 7-segment modules, but using only single
8-bit 'data bus'. The keyword here is 'refresh rate'.

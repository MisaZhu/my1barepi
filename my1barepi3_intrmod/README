TUTORIAL 3
----------

This is an introduction to bare-metal programming on Raspberry Pi using
C language. This module shows how to use the interrupt facility on BCM2835. It
also shows a rewrite of the timer module in order to utilize interrupt.

---------
Objective
---------

1- To explore interrupt facilities available on BCM2835
2- To understand how an interrupt can be used for event triggers (timer)

----------
Background
----------

Interrupts are very useful to have - many applications appreciate having the
possibility of event-based implementation.

--------
Contents
--------

Interrupt module in 'interrupt.c' source and 'interrupt.h' header files.

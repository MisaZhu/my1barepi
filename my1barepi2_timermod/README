TUTORIAL 2
----------

This is an introduction to bare-metal programming on Raspberry Pi using
C language. This module shows how to use the timer available on BCM2835. It
also shows how the GPIO library module can be reused and included here.

Timer module in 'timer.c' source and 'timer.h' header files.

ThingsToThinkAbout
------------------

The free-running counter actually rolls over when it overflows and there is
no way this register can be reset. Find out how this affects the sample code
when the initial timer_read value is actually bigger that the next.

---------
Challenge
---------

See you if can extend the timer library module to include system timer. Write
an example application to test the functions you created. Also, try to compare
the precision of both timers.

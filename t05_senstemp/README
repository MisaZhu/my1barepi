TUTORIAL 05
-----------

This is an introduction to bare-metal programming on Raspberry Pi using
C language. This module creates a program that reads raw data from a
temperature/humidity sensor and dislay a selected value to a pair of
7-segments. A 7-segment interface module has been created for this.

---------
Objective
---------

1- To understand how to display a multi-digit value on 7-segments
2- To understand how a 'protocol' can be implementated

----------
Background
----------

Temperature/humidity sensors are among the most commonly used sensor.

--------
Contents
--------

Codes related to implement the protocol to read from AM2303 Temperature /
Humidity sensor is in 'main.c'. The 7-segment interface code has been
rewritten as a module in '7seg.c' source and '7seg.h' header files.

-----------
ThingsToTry
-----------

* Simple 'Alarm' Indicator
  - modify the code so that an LED will be lit up when temperature is >28deg

TUTORIAL XX

This is an introduction to bare-metal programming on Raspberry Pi using
C language. This module creates a bootloader program so that we do not have
to rewrite that kernel.img so many times. We need an RS232 port on the PC
in order to use this. File transfer is done using XMODEM protocol.

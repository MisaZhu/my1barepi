TUTORIAL 7
----------

This is an introduction to bare-metal programming on Raspberry Pi using
C language. This module creates a program that simply echoes whatever
byte that is detected on the incoming bit banging UART line.

---------
Objective
---------

1. To show how to implement bit banging UART interface terminal

----------
Background
----------

The Raspberry Pi board has only a single UART terminal. Some applications
require more than one - so, a common solution for this is to implement
bit banging technique.

--------
Contents
--------

All codes related to implement bit banging is in 'uartbb.c' source and
'uartbb.h' header files, placed in 'finalized modules' folder.

Challenge
---------

Try to add more baudrate option(s) to the module.

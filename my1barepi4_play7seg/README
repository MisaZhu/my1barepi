TUTORIAL 4
----------

This is an introduction to bare-metal programming on Raspberry Pi using
C language. This module creates a program that counts 0-9 on a 7-segment
when a switch is pushed.

---------
Objective
---------

1- To understand how a 7-segment can be connected for a simple display

----------
Background
----------

For most simple embedded applications, using LCD displays can be an overkill.
One of the most common display alternative (especially for numerical display)
is a 7-segment. It is basically a set of LEDs that are arranged as such that
it can display 0-9 when designated LEDs are turned on.

--------
Contents
--------

All codes related to 7-segment usage are in 'main.c'.

------------------
ThingsToThinkAbout
------------------

There is a limited number of GPIO pins available on the Pi. Can we create
an application that needs 4 x 7-segments? How do we interface them?

---------
Challenge
---------

See if you can create a simple library module for a seven segment. Write
an example application to test the functions you created.

TUTORIAL 05
-----------

This is an introduction to bare-metal programming on Raspberry Pi using
C language. This module creates a program that reads raw data from a
temperature/humidity sensor and dislay a selected value to a pair of
7-segments. A 7-segment interface module has been created for this.

---------
Objective
---------

1- To understand how to display a multi-digit value on 7-segments
2- To understand how a 'protocol' can be implementated

----------
Background
----------

Temperature/humidity sensors are among the most commonly used sensor.

--------
Contents
--------

Only the top-level codes are 'main.c'. The module-specific codes can be found
in respective source files in tZZ_modules/src folder.

-----------
ThingsToTry
-----------

* Simple 'Alarm' Indicator
  - modify the code so that an LED will be lit up when temperature is >28deg

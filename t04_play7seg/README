TUTORIAL 04
-----------

This is an introduction to bare-metal programming on Raspberry Pi using
C language. This module creates a program that counts 0-9 on a 7-segment
when a switch is pushed.

---------
Objective
---------

1- To understand how a 7-segment can be connected for a simple display

----------
Background
----------

For most simple embedded applications, using LCD displays can be an overkill.
One of the most common display alternative (especially for numerical display)
is a 7-segment. It is basically a set of LEDs that are arranged as such that
it can display 0-9 when designated LEDs are turned on.
